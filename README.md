# Airline Signal Detection using Time Series Analysis

### 📖 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and detect patterns in airline traffic signals using Time Series Analysis techniques. The dataset consists of airline traffic data, and the analysis is performed using Python. The project explores trends, seasonality, and forecasting to gain insights into airline signal patterns.

### 📂 Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:
	•	Time_series_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis, including data preprocessing, visualization, and forecasting steps.
	•	Air.csv: The dataset used for the analysis, containing airline traffic data.
	•	README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

### 🚀 How to Use

Prerequisites:
	•	Python 3.x
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Required Python libraries (install them using the command below):

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels

### 📊 Dataset

The dataset Air.csv contains airline traffic data. Below are its key features:
	•	Time: Represents the time period.
	•	Passenger Count: Number of passengers during the given time period.

### 🔍 Key Insights
	1.	Trend Analysis: Identified long-term patterns in airline signals.
	2.	Seasonality: Observed repeating patterns over specific intervals.
	3.	Forecasting: Predicted future airline traffic using time series models.

### 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
	•	Python Libraries:
	•	pandas for data manipulation
	•	numpy for numerical computations
	•	matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
	•	statsmodels for statistical analysis and forecasting
	•	Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and visualization.

### 📈 Results

The project successfully:
	•	Visualized trends and seasonality in the dataset.
	•	Built time series models to forecast airline traffic for future periods.
